              <p className="why-we-built-paragraph">
                Acadova isn't just a product, it's a movement. We started Acadova because we were tired of seeing brilliant people struggle, not because they weren't smart, but because the system wasn't built for how they learned. We've lived that frustration. That "why doesn't this make sense?" feeling. And we knew it could be different.
              </p>
              <p className="why-we-built-paragraph">
                So we created a space where learning finally fits the learner. Where what you learn isn't measured by how long you study, but by how well you actually understand.
              </p>
              <p className="why-we-built-paragraph why-we-built-highlight">
                We're building more than a study tool. We're building a future where every learner feels seen, supported, and empowered to thrive on their own terms. Because learning should never feel like a battle. With Acadova, it feels like freedom.
